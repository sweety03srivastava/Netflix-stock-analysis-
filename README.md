In this project, I took a deep dive into Netflix's stock data to see how it has performed over time. My main goals were to look at the volume of stock traded, track the high, open, and close prices, and analyze these trends on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. I also focused on finding the top 5 days when the stock prices were the highest and lowest.

To do this, I used tools like Pandas to organize the data, Seaborn for creating visualizations, and Matplotlib for plotting graphs. I started by loading and cleaning the data, then created different charts to show how Netflix's stock prices have changed over time. I also pinpointed the key dates when the stock prices were at their peak or their lowest, giving a clear picture of how Netflix’s stock has moved in the market.

This project provides a straightforward look at Netflix’s stock trends, making it a handy resource for anyone interested in understanding stock performance or making informed investment choices.
